Look on `https://chat.deepseek.com/share/ct9kvdsv0haxppxru5` for this prompt:

    Great progress until know. We are going to a new stage, which is to plan the automated scraping of the whole archive.

    There are 12466 documents to scrape, all of them stored under the same URL structure, where it only changes the number at the end of it.

    I wonder several things before figuring a prompt that starts to scrape and store all this into a JSON file:

    1. Currently the script stores the whole data and then it prints it to a JSON file, am I right?
    2. If I am right, what is usually the approach to handle longer datasets? 
    3. Please, evaluate, according to reliable sources, how reasonable is what I have in mind, which is:
    - The script stores and prints 50 items every time. Thus:
    - First, the script loads the JSON file to wonder: what was the last item stored into the database?
    - Based on this, the script starts to scrape 50 items, starting with the URL id number that follows the last item stored
    - When it has collected 50 items, it updates the JSON file with the new 50 items
    - It sleeps for one minute
    - If the id number is less than 12466, it starts again
    4. Over which amount of items should I start to worry about the program breaking?
    5. If this is an issue, is it reasonable to separate the database into JSON file slots, of let's say, 500 items, and then having a script that collects them all?.
I just copied the suggested script into a test folder. It needs to be tested.
